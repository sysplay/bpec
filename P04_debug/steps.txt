Assignment #04

1) Setting up the BSS
	> Add code in switch_test.c to print global variables initialized to non-zero values and non-initialized ones
	> Print in both decimal & hexadecimal
	> Check out the placement of these variables in the map file
	> Observe the BSS (Block Started by Symbol) section peculiarity using switch_test.bin
	> Uncomment BSS related stuff (bss_begin & bss_end) in first.lds (on line # 14 & from line #17),
		And Uncomment line #6 & the _clear_bss code (from line # 10) in first_startup.s
	> Observe the difference
	> Take a snapshot of difference and send it to SysPlay's WhatsApp number, NOT the WhatsApp group, for gradation

2) Printing the Registers
	> Add code in switch_test.c to display the Device Id (Refer Sec 1.1.2 in Docs/am335x_trm.pdf)
	> Send the image of its output on BBB to SysPlay's WhatsApp number, NOT the WhatsApp group, for gradation

3) Printing a Byte
	> Implement void print_hex_byte(uint8_t n) in debug.c and prototype it in debug.h
	> Send the image of the code snippet to SysPlay's WhatsApp number, NOT the WhatsApp group, for gradation

4) Timer Walkthrough
	> Skim through the timer* code
	> Blink an LED (w/ fixed period) using timer_test.bin (Hint: Add timer_test.c in Makefile)
